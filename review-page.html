                <p>Despite the subpar seat, my first international trip on Delta Air Lines in business class didn’t disappoint. I had great service on both legs and Miriam on the flight from Rio to NYC was wonderful, reflecting well on Delta Air Lines as a whole. The food was good, all things considered, and despite wear and tear, the business-class cabins on Delta’s 767-300s still look good. The biggest disappointment was the seat, which felt narrow and wasn’t great for sleeping. The new Delta One suites are far, far superior to this product, which is showing its age. But for the right price, like $1,200 round-trip to Brazil and back, I’d happily fly it again.</p>
